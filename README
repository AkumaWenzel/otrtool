otrtool aims to provide an open source tool to deal with otrkey-files from
onlinetvrecoder.com. At the moment it is able to decrypt them, in the
future a download manager and/or EPG could be added.

== HISTORY ==

In April, 2010, eddy14 reverse-engineered the otrkey-file-format and OTRs
Client-Server-protocol. The blog post describing his work (german):
    http://41yd.de/blog/2010/04/18/otrkey-breaker/
He also wrote a proove-of-concept tool to decrypt OTRKEY's. I rewrote it in
proper C and without licensing issues.

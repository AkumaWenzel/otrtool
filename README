otrtool aims to provide an open source tool to deal with otrkey-files from
onlinetvrecoder.com. At the moment it is able to decrypt them, in the
future a download manager and/or EPG could be added.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

* libmcrypt (for blowfish)
* libcurl / curl
* openssl (for md5, should be quite easy to get rid of this dependency)

== BUILDING ==

Just run the following command from the root of the repository:
    gcc -g -Wall -lmcrypt -lssl -lcurl -o otrtool src/main.c
This will create the "otrtool" binary.

== LINKS ==

github repository:      http://github.com/pyropeter/otrtool
bugtracker:             http://github.com/pyropeter/otrtool/issues

== REPORTING BUGS ==

For bug reports please run otrtool with the "-v"-option. Note that the output
contains personal data like your email/password, and/or hashes of thiese.

== HISTORY ==

In April, 2010, eddy14 reverse-engineered the otrkey-file-format and OTRs
Client-Server-protocol. The blog post describing his work (german):
    http://41yd.de/blog/2010/04/18/otrkey-breaker/
He also wrote a proove-of-concept tool to decrypt OTRKEY's. I rewrote it in
proper C and without licensing issues.

otrtool aims to provide an open source tool to deal with otrkey-files from
onlinetvrecoder.com. At the moment it is able to decrypt them, in the
future a download manager and/or EPG could be added.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

* libmcrypt             for blowfish
* libcurl / curl        for the server request

== BUILDING ==

* execute `make`

* Copy the following files to the places they belong:
    ./otrtool           the main binary
    ./otrtool.1.gz      the gzip'ed manpage
    ./LICENSE           the (rights waiver) license

== REPORTING BUGS ==

For bug reports please run otrtool with the "-v"-option. Note that the output
contains personal data like your email/password, and/or hashes of them.

== VERSION NUMBERS ==

The version numbers follow the scheme major.minor.bugfixes.
This means that as long as /bugfixes/ increases the software gets more stable.
/Major/ is only incremented on great architectural changes.

== HISTORY ==

In April, 2010, eddy14 reverse-engineered the otrkey-file-format and OTRs
Client-Server-protocol. The blog post describing his work (german):
    http://41yd.de/blog/2010/04/18/otrkey-breaker/
He also wrote a proof-of-concept tool to decrypt OTRKEYs. I rewrote it in
proper C and without licensing issues.

== LICENSE ==

otrtool uses the CC0-license.

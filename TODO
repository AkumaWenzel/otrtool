* manpage
* I don't trust my decryptFile(). Check for signed overflows and add
  proper handling of EOF.

* config in ~
* otrkey-cache for passphrases
* twittelevision
* read email + pass from stdin
* pretty formatting for -i
* upgrade to weapon of mass destruction (multiple input files)
  * Implemention of "-D"-option

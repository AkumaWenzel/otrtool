== Until 1.0 ==

* Offer to overwrite destination file in decryptFile()
* upgrade to weapon of mass destruction (multiple input files)
  * there are various little memory leaks in fetchKeypharse()
* more error-proof EOF handling in decryptFile()
  * piping in otrkeys using "tail -f" should be possible
* guimode: disable interactivity
  * fetchKeyphrase(): email and password
  * decryptFile(): destination file overwriting (once implemented)

== Optional ==

* argv[0] could be checked for .../otrdecoder to add -x automatically
  packages could then just link /bin/otrdecoder -> /bin/otrtool
  * Would this be option-compatible to the proprietary otrdecoder?
* config in ~
* otrkey-cache for passphrases
* twittelevision
* pretty formatting for -i
* check integrity of decrypted file
  * where is the hash saved/in what format? (header is more likely, imo)

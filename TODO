== Essential ==

* I don't trust my decryptFile(). Check for signed overflows and add
  proper handling of EOF.

== Optional ==

* argv[0] could be checked for .../otrdecoder to add -x automatically
  packages could then just link /bin/otrdecoder -> /bin/otrtool
  * Would this be option-compatible to the proprietary otrdecoder?

* config in ~
* otrkey-cache for passphrases
* twittelevision
* pretty formatting for -i
* upgrade to weapon of mass destruction (multiple input files)
  * Implemention of "-D"-option
* check integrity of decrypted file
  * where is the hash saved/in what format? (header is more likely, imo)
